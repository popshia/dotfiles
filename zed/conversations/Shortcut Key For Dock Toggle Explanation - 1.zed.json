Let's break it down:\n\n1. `\"context\": \"ProjectPanel\"` - This indicates that these key bindings are active when in the context of a Project Panel (likely a specific panel or view in the application)\n\n2. `\"bindings\"` - This section defines the actual keyboard shortcuts\n\n3. `\"space e\": \"workspace::ToggleLeftDock\"` - This is the specific key binding:\n   - The key combination is \"space e\" (pressing the spacebar followed by 'e')\n   - When pressed, it triggers the command \"workspace::ToggleLeftDock\"\n   - This command likely toggles (shows/hides) the left dock/panel of the workspace\n\nThis type of configuration is common in text editors like VS Code, Atom, or similar applications where users can customize keyboard shortcuts for different actions. The `space` key is often used as a \"leader\" key in such configurations, similar to how Vim uses keyboard combinations.\n\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":151,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":1113,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":42},"start":1114,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"cloud language model completion failed with status 400 Bad Request: messages: final assistant content cannot end with trailing whitespace"},"timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":53}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":43},"start":1115,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":48}}}],"summary":"Shortcut Key For Dock Toggle Explanation","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
